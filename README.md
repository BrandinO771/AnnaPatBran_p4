<h1> Machine Learning Image Detection - Cooking App </h1>

<h4> 1.) In a webpage the user uploads a picture of food ingredients, our machine learning model analyzes the image 
and returns all of the ingredients it identifies.</h4> 
<h4> 2.) The user then comfirms the ingredients detected. </h4> 
<h4> 3.) Then we provide a list of recipies that the user can make based on their ingredients! </h4>


Our team used Python Library ImageAI and the yolo model type to train our model on thousands of hand annotated images.
This was a proof of concept where we only trained on ingredients for making a hamburger. 
We use Flask to run our webserver, external recipe API requests, and our ML image detection model. 
We used Javascript and D3 to process API requests to Flask, populate web content such as 
check boxes, and recipe cards, and to listen to button events.
